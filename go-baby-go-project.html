                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>GoBabyGo is a grassroots organization centered around the modification of off-the-shelf
                            ride-on-cars to provide an alternative to traditional powered mobility devices for children
                            with motor disabilities. For this project, I worked on a team with four other Oregon State
                            Students in order to improve the communication and socialization between members and
                            families involved with GoBabyGo and to provide a central organized location of information
                            for
                            GoBabyGo with the development of a cross-platform mobile application, available for both
                            Android and iOS users.

                    <h2>Roles and Responsibilites</h2>
                    <p>My main responsibilities for this project included the app design, database design and
                        implementation, and the timelog and edit goals pages of the application. Application design was
                        divided up among team members and then discussed together to come up with the final design.
                        Weekly meetings with our project partners were used to discuss the designs during the initial
                        phase of the project. For the design of the database, I worked on creating a database that would
                        best utilize the required information we wanted to store. Since we chose to work with firebase
                        realtime database which is
                        a NoSQL database, data was structured as a json object. My contributions to the application’s
                        front-end development include the Timelog page and the Edit Goal page where users can go to
                        record the time spent on an activity and set their weekly time goal. Screenshots of these two
                        pages are below.

                    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                    <p>In order to implement the Realtime Database, we made the decision to use Google’s Firebase
                        Realtime Database which implements a JSON Tree as the main structure. The Realtime Database from
                        Firebase met our technical requirements and was a necessary tool in order to move the project
                        forward.
                    </p>

                    <p>Because we needed to implement a cross-platform smartphone application, we needed to utilize both
                        Android Studio and Xcode in order to verify that the application was working properly on both
                        Android and iOS. The Android Studio Suite of tools comes with an Android Virtual Device (AVD)
                        Emulator that we used to test the application on an Android platform. As far as the
                        implementation of Dart and Flutter Software Development Kit (SDK) Android Studio made it very
                        simple to set up the SDK and utilize flutter commands within the terminal in Android Studio.</p>

                    <p>In order to develop our application for iOS devices, we needed to make changes to the code via
                        Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment for macOS. While most of our implementation
                        was done through Android Studio, we used Xcode for various iOS specific changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>Figma was utilized extensively throughout the design process of the application. During
                        development phase, the high-fidelity Figma prototype was crucial to ensure consistency within
                        our app.
                        It was also really beneficial to have in order to show our project partner what their
                        application would look like at the conclusion of the capstone project process.

                    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
                    <p>This project allowed me to create a full project from start to finish. It taught me a lot about
                        what it takes to work on a team of software developers and how to communicate effectively with
                        them and our project partners. Additionally, I learned new tools and technologies. Prior to this
                        project, I had never worked with mobile app development. I now feel comfortable using xCode,
                        Android Studio, Flutter, and NoSQL databases.
