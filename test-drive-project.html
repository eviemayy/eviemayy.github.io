                                   project with a group of three UX interns and one software engineering intern to
                                   create a mobile application to aid car dealerships in
                                   adapting to the COVID-19 Pandemic and the fundamental shift to a younger consumer

                         <h2>Research</h2>
                         <p>Since our team was brand new to CDK and its products, we began by conducting some
                              preliminary generative research.
                              We spoke with a number of employees at the company to better understand the needs and
                              wants of our clients. It started
                              to become clear that there was a gap in our product line when it came to addressing the
                              Pandemic and the younger
                              customers that are now purchasing vehicles online. </p>

                         <p>After an initial ideation meeting we decided to move forward with a Progressive Web
                              Application that dealers could use to schedule
                              test drives remotely for customers. Since dealerships have seen an increase in younger
                              buyers we wanted to focus the experience on
                              mobile, specifically social media conversions.</p>

                         <p>Now that we knew what we wanted to build, we began conducting some competitive analysis of
                              similar products in market and research
                              into inventive UI patterns that could separate our application from the rest of the crowd
                              while maintaining the most effective
                              user experience.</p>

                         <p>After researching into the space our product would live, we began to focus on it’s users. We
                              synthesized five personas from the user
                              research we conducted. We did this to better understand who the users of our product would
                              be while ideating and designing.</p>

                              After synthesizing these concepts into design requirements we generated two user workflows
                              and created low fidelity wireframes that
                              would become the basis of our designs.</p>

                         <p>Although we didn't win the hackathon, our project is now being considered for actual
                              implementation at CDK. This might help the company transition to a more
                              modern design perspective.</p>
                         <p>If this project were to continue, I would have liked to conduct more usability testing on
                              the developed application to ensure a seamless experience
                              for users looking to test drive a variety of vehicles from their home. Also given the time
                              constraints and COVID limiting our access to participants,
                              I would have liked to test on a wider range of individuals to get a more accurate
                              represention of the potential users of this product.</p>
