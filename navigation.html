            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>I was tasked to work on a team to design an application that was inclusive to the Deaf community for an Inclusive Design 
                course I took at OSU. This course was focused on how to design for inclusivity and the persona development life cycle in 
                order to properly represent and serve the underserved populations. In this case, we needed to make our app usable to both 
                mainstream users as well as the deaf community. Our team met in person 1-2 times a week over the course of ten weeks 
                to work on this project.

                <br>Time Frame: 10 Weeks 
                <br>Tools: Paper Prototypes, Balsamiq</p>

            <h1 class="case-study-header" id="research">Research</h1>
            <p>In order to fully understand who we were designing for, our group conducted a combination of qualitative and quantitative 
                research. We focused mostly on learning about the underserved, deaf population. Our main sources for data were through 
                online articles and informal personal interviews with deaf individuals. Since one team member had close connections with 
                friends who were deaf, she was in charge of all the interviews. The rest of us collected data through research papers and 
                online personal anecdotes from deaf individuals. We collected our findings on a shared google doc and later came together 
                to synthesize our findings. </p>
            
            <h1 class="case-study-header" id="persona-development">Persona Development</h1>
            <p>We then took our research findings and created affinity diagrams. We layed out specific facts we found on a table and 
                categorized them into similar groupings. By doing this, we were able to create facets for our persona skeletons.</p>
            <img class="case-study-img affinity-img" src="photos/Inclusive-Case-Study/Affinity.png" />
            <p>Our team created two personas; one representing the underserved population: a deaf individual and the other represented the 
                mainstream population. This way we had a representation front he two ends of the spectrum. From there we then fleshed out 
                our personas and further developed them:</p>
            <div class="case-study-img persona-img">
                    <img src="photos/Inclusive-Case-Study/Sam.png"/>
                    <img src="photos/Inclusive-Case-Study/Bailey.png"/>
            </div>

            <h1 class="case-study-header" id="ideation">Ideation</h1>
            <p>After creating our personas, we were ready to begin wireframing. Each team member came up with a couple rough sketch ideas 
                on their own. We then came together to share ideas. From there, we were able to further develop our wireframe sketches.</p>
            <p>We also participated in a classroom showcase where we displayed our wireframes and received input from other teams. This 
                allowed us to make changes and improvements to our design so far.</p>

                <img class="wireframe-img" src="photos/Inclusive-Case-Study/Wireframe3.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="wireframes">
                <img class="wireframe-img" src="photos/Inclusive-Case-Study/Wireframe4.png"/>
                <img class="wireframe-img" src="photos/Inclusive-Case-Study/Wireframe5.png"/>
                <img class="wireframe-img" src="photos/Inclusive-Case-Study/Wireframe6.png"/>
            </div>
                
            
            
            <h1 class="case-study-header" id="testing">Usability Evaluation</h1>
            <p>Once we had a low fidelity prototype we felt good about, our group conducted a cognitive walkthrough using our two personas.
                With a goal in mind, we evaluated each step our personas would need to make to navigate through our application. If we felt 
                our persona would not have made the choice we had intended, we noted it down and then revisited the prototype afterwards to 
                make the appropriate changes.</p>

            <h1 class="case-study-header" id="prototype">Prototypes</h1>
            <p>From here we moved on to develop more mid-fidelity prototypes using Balamiq. As a team, we collaboratively designed the 
                prototype.</p>
            <p>From there, we participated in another classroom showcase were we were able to get input from our classmates. After this we 
                made our final changes.</p>
            <img class="case-study-img prototype-img" src="photos/Navigation-Cover.png" />
            
                <h1 class="case-study-header">Reflection</h1>
            <p>This project taught me the importance of designing for inclusivity. There is such a wide range of reasons why a person might not be able to use a piece of software. Designing with the user in mind is crucial in order to prevent exclusion. I also learned about how helpful personas can be in the design process. They really help you visualize your user and their needs and expectations.</p>
            <p>Given more time and resources I would have liked to create high fidelity prototypes and conduct user interviews on those, focusing on our underserved deaf population.</p>
