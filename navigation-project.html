                              <p>In fall of 2019 I took an Inclusive Design course at OSU. This course was focused on
                                   how to design for inclusivity and the persona
                                   development life cycle in order to properly represent and serve the underserved
                                   populations. I was tasked to work on a team of four to design
                                   an application that was inclusive to the Deaf community. In this case, we needed to
                                   make our app usable to both mainstream users as
                                   well as the deaf community. Our team met in person 1-2 times a week over the course
                                   of ten weeks to work on this project.</p>

                         <h2>Research</h2>
                         <p>In order to fully understand who we were designing for, our group conducted a combination of
                              qualitative and quantitative research.
                              We focused mostly on learning about the underserved, deaf population. Our main sources for
                              data were through online articles and
                              informal personal interviews with deaf individuals. Since one team member had close
                              connections with friends who were deaf, she was
                              in charge of all the interviews. The rest of us collected data through research papers and
                              online personal anecdotes from deaf
                              individuals. We collected our findings on a shared google doc and later came together to
                              synthesize our findings.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="project-detail-text">
                         <h2>Persona Development</h2>
                         <p>We then took our research findings and created affinity diagrams. We layed out specific
                              facts we found through our research on a
                              table and categorized them into similar groupings. By doing this, we were able to create
                              facets for our persona skeletons.</p>

                         <div class="photo-box">
                              <img src="photos/Inclusive-Case-Study/Affinity.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                         </div>

                         <p>Our team created two personas; one representing the underserved population: a deaf
                              individual, and the other represented the
                              mainstream population. This way we had representation from the two ends of the spectrum of
                              potential users. From there we then
                              "fleshed out" our personas and further developed them:</p>

                         <h2>Ideation</h2>
                         <p>After creating our personas, we were ready to begin wireframing. Each team member came up
                              with a couple rough sketch ideas on their own. We
                              then came together to share ideas. From there, we were able to further develop our
                              wireframe sketches.</p>
                         <p>We also participated in a classroom showcase where we displayed our wireframes and received
                              input from other teams. This allowed us to make
                              changes and improvements to our design so far.</p>

                              personas would need to make to navigate through our application. If we felt our persona
                              would not have made the choice we had intended, we noted it down and then revisited the
                              prototype afterwards to make the appropriate changes.</p>

                         <p>This project taught me the importance of designing for inclusivity. There is such a wide
                              range of reasons why a person might not be
                              able to use a piece of software. Designing with the user in mind is crucial in order to
                              prevent exclusion. I was also able to get a lot of
                              practice creating and working with personas.</p>
                         <p>Given more time and resources I would have liked to create high fidelity prototypes and
                              conduct user interviews on those, focusing on our underserved deaf population.</p>
